IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone project


In the burgeoning commercial space era, companies like Virgin Galactic, Rocket Lab, Blue Origin, and notably SpaceX are revolutionizing space travel accessibility. SpaceX's achievements span launching spacecraft to the ISS, pioneering satellite internet via Starlink, and executing manned space missions. A critical factor behind SpaceX's success is cost-effectiveness attributed to reusable rockets; their Falcon 9 launches cost $62 million, in contrast to competitors' $165 million. To ascertain launch costs, the pivotal first stage recovery's outcome can be predicted using machine learning, obviating complex rocket science. As a data scientist at Space Y, an aspiring SpaceX rival, I'm tasked with gathering SpaceX insights, constructing informative dashboards, and training a predictive model for first stage reusability. Leveraging these data science tools, I'm steering Space Y's quest to establish a competitive foothold in the commercial space race.

# Questions to be answered
How do variables such as payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbits affect the success of the first stage landing?
Does the rate of successful landings increase over the years?
What is the best algorithm that can be used for binary classification in this case?
