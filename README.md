As a data scientist at Space Y, an aspiring SpaceX rival, I'm tasked with gathering SpaceX insights, constructing informative dashboards, and training a predictive model for first stage reusability. Leveraging these data science tools, I'm steering Space Y's quest to establish a competitive foothold in the commercial space race.

# Questions to be answered
How do variables such as payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbits affect the success of the first stage landing?
Does the rate of successful landings increase over the years?
What is the best algorithm that can be used for binary classification in this case?
# Methodology
1. Data collection methodology
Using SpaceX Rest API
Using Web Scrapping from Wikipedia
2. Performed data wrangling
Filtering the data
Dealing with missing values
Using One Hot Encoding to prepare the data to a binary classification
3. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization and SQL
4. Performed interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash
5. Performed predictive analysis using classification models
Building, tuning and evaluation of classification models to ensure the best results
