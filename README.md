# Capstone-Project-IBM-DataScience-Specialization
IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone project

In my data science project, I employed a range of essential tools. Beginning with data collection, I gathered and preprocessed raw data from various sources. Utilizing Python's pandas library, I conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset's structure and characteristics. Leveraging scikit-learn, I performed feature engineering and selection, preparing the data for modeling. Employing a variety of machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, I trained predictive models, optimizing their hyperparameters with cross-validation. To enhance model performance, I employed techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. I communicated my findings through data visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn, effectively conveying complex information to stakeholders.
